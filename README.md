# CookGuide

Description: By leveraging smart home tools, like amazon Alexa, we hope to help elderly maintain their autonomy by assisting them with the common household task of cooking. The application will help manage the meal schedule for the user, and walk them through the steps of cooking their meal in real time, while providing utilities like reminders and timers.
